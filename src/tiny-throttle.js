/**
 * Super-tiny but powerful callback wrapper and throttler.
 * Ensures that the last occurred event is always called, even if it falls between the throttling threshold.
 * It can apply the original scope to the fn.
 * Itâ€™s able to distinguish timeslot position in which the fn has been called {'head'|'body'|'tail'}
 *
 * @author: Marco Bozzola <marco@basili.co>
 *
 * @param  {Function} fn        original callback to be throttled
 * @param  {int}      threshold throttling threshold
 * @param  {scope}    scope     scope to be applied to the callback
 * @param  {bool}     forceTail whether to force a second fn call (with position='tail') even if the callback fired only once (in one timeslot)
 * @return {Function} throttled function, with an added parameter to distinguish timeslot position in which the fn has been called {'head'|'body'|'tail'}
